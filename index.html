  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of my favorite new features in TFS 2012 are the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jasonz/archive/2012/05/29/my-favorite-features-managing-projects-with-the-backlog-sprint-planning-and-taskboard-features-in-team-foundation-server-11.aspx">significant improvements</a> to the TFS web client.  Sprint planning and execution has never been easier - especially for remote teams - when using the new team task board in TFS 2012.</p>

<h3>The Perfect World</h3>

<p>I have been working with a remote team for the last two years and our biggest challenge has always been communication - especially because <em>everyone</em> is remote, not just one or two individuals.  The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scrumshortcuts/6435649305/">Daily Scrum</a> helps keep the communication lines flowing for the team at the beginning of each day.  Being part of a remote team, this is usually handled with an audio conference bridge.  And more often than not, it&#8217;s challenging to form a good understanding of what each team member is actively working on.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, if we were all colocated, this wouldn&#8217;t be an issue - the development team would reap the benefits of standing together as a group for our Daily Scrum, gathered in the same room, most likely in front of a physical task board used to track work throughout the sprint.  Everyone would be able to identify what work has been completed, what is in progress, and what is remaining.  We could even plot our own burndown on the white board to gauge if we will finish on time.</p>

<h3>Reality</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, the colocated Daily Scrum isn&#8217;t an option for us, but the next best thing is for the team to review the new team task board together.  The team task board, which ships with both Team Foundation Server 2012 and TF Service, is a virtual representation of the physical task board used by colocated teams.  Virtual sticky notes can be moved from one swim lane to another, while updating the affected work items behind the scenes.<br/>
<strong>Bonus: Have a touch-enabled desktop or Windows 8 tablet?  The task board supports touch events, allowing users to drag virtual stickies from one swim lane to the next. </strong></p>

<p>Simply reviewing the task board together as a team on a daily basis not only helped ensure everyone was actively working on what we committed to at the beginning of the sprint, but also helped everyone on the team form a shared understanding of what each team member is working on and how that work fits into the team&#8217;s overall sprint goals.  Team collaboration and communication for the win.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are interested in learning and playing around with the new features in Visual Studio 2012 and Team Foundation Server 2012, but do not have access to a TFS 2012 environment yet (or maybe you get slapped on the wrist every time you try to install something new on your work machine), then the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/briankel/archive/2011/09/16/visual-studio-11-application-lifecycle-management-virtual-machine-and-hands-on-labs-demo-scripts.aspx">Visual Studio 2012 Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) Virtual Machine</a> is for you.&nbsp; </p> <p>The ALM demo virtual machine includes both Visual Studio 2012 and Team Foundation Server 2012, plus you also get 20 hands on labs that walk you through all of the new features. The demo virtual machine is only good for a trial period of 180 days, but you can most likely expect a refreshed version of the virtual machine from Microsoft before then.&nbsp; </p> <h3>VirtualBox Support</h3> <p>The demo virtual machine will also work with VirtualBox, even though the blog post and release notes state the machine is built for Hyper-V.&nbsp; </p> <p>To run the virtual machine with VirtualBox, download and expand the self-extracting RAR files first, following the instructions provided in Brian Keller’s blog post.&nbsp; </p> <p>After extracting, you now need to create a new virtual machine using VirtualBox.&nbsp; When creating the new virtual machine, specify Windows 2008 (64-bit) for the VM operating system.&nbsp; </p> <p><a href="/images/posts/SNAGHTML562929a.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="SNAGHTML562929a" border="0" alt="SNAGHTML562929a" src="/images/posts/SNAGHTML562929a_thumb.png" width="553" height="361"></a></p> <p>Specify an appropriate amount of memory for your new virtual machine on the next screen.&nbsp; The amount of memory you designate for your virtual machine may vary on the hardware in your machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p><a href="/images/posts/SNAGHTML56ea38b.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="SNAGHTML56ea38b" border="0" alt="SNAGHTML56ea38b" src="/images/posts/SNAGHTML56ea38b_thumb.png" width="551" height="360"></a></p> <p>For the Virtual Hard Disk, specify “Use existing hard disk” and locate the vhd that was contained in the folder structure generated by the self-extracting RAR files.&nbsp; </p> <p><a href="/images/posts/SNAGHTML563d718.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="SNAGHTML563d718" border="0" alt="SNAGHTML563d718" src="/images/posts/SNAGHTML563d718_thumb.png" width="558" height="364"></a></p> <p>You’re almost done – click Create!</p> <p>After creating, you will need to make sure you do one last step.&nbsp; Hyper-V will only build a bootable IDE hard disk, so you will need to change the settings of your new virtual machine to attach the hard disk as a bootable IDE, instead of SATA, which is the default.&nbsp; Just delete the existing hard disk, which was by default attached via the SATA controller, and add a new hard disk using the IDE controller, again pointing to the vhd which you extracted earlier.&nbsp; </p> <p>Thanks to Olof Szymczak for explaining <a href="http://ollysense.blogspot.com/2010/05/virtualbox-using-hyper-v-vhd-image.html">how to open a Hyper-V VM in VirtualBox</a>.&nbsp; </p> <p><a href="/images/posts/SNAGHTML572dd9e.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="SNAGHTML572dd9e" border="0" alt="SNAGHTML572dd9e" src="/images/posts/SNAGHTML572dd9e_thumb.png" width="565" height="422"></a></p> <p>You are done.&nbsp; Launch your ALM virtual machine and “get your learning on!”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The project I am currently working on is using Team Foundation Server for builds and we have a lot of build definitions.  The project is a large enterprise-level project, with multiple Visual Studio solutions.  Each Visual Studio solution has at least two branches – maybe more – and usually a corresponding build definition for most of those branches.  Hopefully that gives you a good idea of the number of build definitions.</p>

<p>One of my coworkers at this client was nice enough to point me towards the Inmeta Build Explorer add-in for Visual Studio.  The add-in plugs directly into the Team Explorer window in Visual Studio and provides you an organized hierarchical list of the build definitions in your team project.  This is done using a naming convention for the builds in your team project.  The add-in uses “.” as the default separator, but the developers of the add-in were nice enough to make it customizable.  And the Inmeta Build Explorer add-in is a client plugin, so only the developers on your team that are interested in using it have to install it – if you don’t look at the build definitions on a daily basis, then you don’t have to install it.</p>

<p>Just to give you an idea of the structure of the builds underneath the Inmeta Build Explorer node, here is what the Inmeta Build Explorer add-in looks like in our team project.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/images/posts/Win7Dev-1-1-2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-214 aligncenter" title="Win7Dev-1-1-2" src="/images/posts/Win7Dev-1-1-2.jpg" alt="" width="318" height="342" /></a></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another nice feature of this add-in is the ability to easily queue up the “default” build for a specific build definition.  If you right-click on one of the builds, an option named “Queue Default Build(s)” is available on the context menu.  Selecting this will automatically queue a new build for that build definition, bypassing the build properties window that lets you override the default build settings.</p>

<p>You can get the Inmeta Build Explorer on the Visual Studio Gallery.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Caffeine, pizza, and anxiety are regular tools for a production deployment.  Watch and learn how Team Foundation Build 2010 and MSDeploy can turn the last hurdle of software development into a moment of zen.  Deploying software can be hard, but it doesn’t have to be if you practice the hard things along the way.</p>

<p>In this webinar, we’ll take a look at how to configure a new <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181710(VS.80).aspx" target="_blank">Team Build</a> definition for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration" target="_blank">Continuous Integration</a>.  Then we will walk through creating an MSDeploy package from an ASP.NET MVC project, and automate the execution of the MSDeploy package to remote servers using our Continuous Integration build definition.</p>

<p>The webinar will be April 28th from 12pm-1pm EST.  For more information and to register to attend, check out the <a href="http://www.sds-consulting.com/tfs-training-series-free-continuous-deployment-team-build-and-msdeploy" target="_blank">Strategic Data Systems website</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1301795502&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"><em>Rework</em></a> by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson. Pub by Crown Publishing. ISBN 10 9780307463746.</p>

<p>So I know that this book has been out for awhile, and actually, I have owned this book for awhile.  Actually, if we’re being exact, I’ve owned two copies of this book for quite some time now.  It’s a funny story… ok, so not actually, but anyway – here is why I have two copies of this book.  I ordered the book off <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a> when it first hit bookshelves.  However, I wanted to read it so badly and I couldn’t wait until it was shipped to my house, so I picked up a copy at the local <a href="http://www.booksandco.com/" target="_blank">Books and Company</a> store.  I took that copy home, and started to read it.  And, eventually, the copy I had ordered off Amazon.com finally arrived.  Although at that point, life had already moved on and I never did remember to take back the original copy I had picked up at Books and Company.  So, now I have two copies.  And I finally finished reading one of those copies just a couple weeks ago on the plane, and here is the review.  This blog post does have a point – I promise.</p>

<p><em>Rework</em> is one of the most interesting – and most realistic – business books I have seen in a while.  And it’s one of the more unique business books I have read.  It’s unique because, in all of its simplicity, the authors of this book seem to understand how to start (and run) a business more than most others.</p>

<p>The authors start off with some very basic suggestions on how to start your own business.  But rather than walk you through the step-by-step process for creating everything from business cards to marketing material, they help the reader consider the most important things first.  You don’t have to give up your 9-5 job to start doing something you love.  You can start working on something with a little as an hour a day, and if you’re truly passionate about this interest and it’s more than a hobby, then you will stick with it – oh, and about those business cards – they can wait.  The key is to prioritize your list of tasks and expenses, and focus on the most important things first.</p>

<p>The book continues by discussing how to build your idea into a productive business, when to grow (or not grow) your business, and how to deal with everyday business scenarios like hiring, marketing, and bad press.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a no-crap book on how to turn your ideas into a sustainable business, then look no further – start by reading <em>Rework</em>.</p>

<p>I made the switch to <a href="http://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>.  My blog was originally hosted with <a href="http://www.blogger.com" target="_blank">Blogger</a>, but in the beginning of February, I received an email from <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> stating that only 0.5% of the active blogs published using Blogger were using the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/blogger/bin/topic.py?hl=en&amp;topic=12460" target="_blank">FTP publishing option</a> and they are <a href="http://blogger-ftp.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">no longer going to support this feature</a>.  I really liked the FTP publishing option that was available to Blogger users because it allowed me to host my blog “inside” a typical <a href="http://www.asp.net/" target="_blank">ASP.NET</a> site, complete with <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> and even <a href="http://www.silverlight.net/" target="_blank">Silverlight</a> and/or <a href="http://www.adobe.com/flashplatform/" target="_blank">Flash</a> content.  Unfortunately, this publishing option is no longer supported after March 26th, so WordPress is my new home.</p>

<h3>New Blog Template – Extremely Simple</h3>

<p>I also decided to switch up the blog template during the transition from Blogger to WordPress.  The original blog template was pretty simple and this one is even simpler.  This blog is about the content and not the theme, so keeping the theme simple is important to me.</p>

<h3>New Posts – Coming Soon</h3>

<p>Finally, new posts are on their way.  I have about 3 new posts in progress now, mostly technical focused posts as of right now, with the exception of one post on developer soft skills.  Look for these coming soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A colleague of mine and I were confronted with an issue today when we did not perform a proper code search before making some database schema changes to an existing SQL Server 2008 database.&#160; This made me realize that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever performed an impact analysis on code within SQL Server.&#160; Impact analysis on my application code is like second nature to me, but the idea of analyzing my SQL Server code was not something I had thought of before.</p>  <p>Impact analysis is extremely important when making changes to an existing application - especially if the changes you are making include database schema changes.&#160; This is even more important if the application you are changing is an existing production application. if users are working with your application, they aren&#8217;t going to be happy if they have runtime errors in their application every time you touch the codebase.&#160; The specific project my colleague and I are working on is still in development, so we didn&#8217;t cause any major production issues as a result of the schema changes we made, however, this may not be the case every time we make schema changes in the future.</p>  <p>A quick search on <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> shows that I&#8217;m not the first developer to ask this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1364633/search-for-a-key-word-in-all-the-stored-procs-for-a-given-db">question</a>.&#160; Also, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the last person to ask about it either, so I thought it was worth repeating here in case anyone else is interested.</p>  <p>In my scenario, I needed a way to search all of the existing stored procedures to see if an existing database column and relationship were referenced.&#160; The easiest way to do this is a quick keyword search through all of the stored procedures.&#160; Our database has over 100 stored procedures, so searching each one by hand wasn&#8217;t feasible.&#160; Plus, we&#8217;re developers - when we are confronted with situations like this in the future, we should be looking for a quick way to automate this type of task.</p>  <p>One of the responses to this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1364633/search-for-a-key-word-in-all-the-stored-procs-for-a-given-db">question on StackOverflow</a> suggest running a quick SQL query against the database you want to search, plugging in the keyword you want to search for.</p>  <pre>SELECT DISTINCT(sysobjects.name)<br />FROM sysobjects,syscomments
WHERE sysobjects.id = syscomments.id
AND sysobjects.type = 'P'
AND sysobjects.category=0
AND CHARINDEX(&lt;the keyword&gt;,syscomments.text)&gt;0</pre>

<p>Just replace the placeholder &#8216;&lt;the keyword&gt;&#8217; with the keyword you want to find.&#160; This query can easily be thrown into a stored procedure (with the keyword as a parameter) and you can call this every time you need to perform an impact analysis on your SQL Server stored procedures before making changes in the future.&#160; Your colleagues. and your boss. will appreciate this, trust me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I will be speaking at the upcoming University of Dayton School of Engineering Career Day.  This event is open to high school students, parents, guidance counselors, and teachers that are interested in learning more about engineering disciplines and the University of Dayton School of Engineering.  After presentations by engineers in each of the major engineering fields, students are treated to lunch and tours of the schools engineering labs (which have just been recently updated, so I&#8217;m excited to go back and see them).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m honored to be asked back as a speaker at this event (I&#8217;ve spoken at this event several times in the past) and look forward to sharing my experiences as a computer engineer.  Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to generate some interest in the exciting opportunities that are available in our field!</p>

<p>For more info on the event, check out the info page <a href="http://www.udayton.edu/engineering/hs_programs/career_awareness_day.php">here</a>.  Unfortunately registration is full, but you can add your name to a wait list if you are interested in attending.</p>
