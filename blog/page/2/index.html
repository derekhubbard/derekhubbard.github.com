  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a developer, I think it&#8217;s really important to stay involved in the community.&#160; Attending local user groups, code camps, and conferences are a great way to connect and stay involved with other developers in your community - this is on top of the great content presented in the sessions at these events.&#160; These community venues are great, but a lot of times they only occur on a limited basis in our local areas - once a month for user groups unless you live in an area with additional user groups in a neighboring city and, in the case of most code camps<a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_OEUY07e5x-k/SrKLbBxPorI/AAAAAAAAAEY/M-DJxUf5OPM/s1600-h/coffeebeans3.jpg"><img border="0" alt="coffeebeans" align="right" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_OEUY07e5x-k/SrKLbwholrI/AAAAAAAAAEc/t9bWUeS6prw/coffeebeans_thumb1.jpg?imgmax=800" width="244" height="164" /></a> and conferences, maybe once per year.</p>  <p>Code and Coffee is a great way to keep community going on a more frequent basis.&#160; This is typically an informal meet up on a scheduled basis - usually once a week - at a coffee shop in your neighborhood.&#160; Just about every coffee shop has large group tables, free wifi, and caffeine and you would be amazed at how much you can learn just by doing an hour or two of pair programming with other developers in your area.&#160; </p>  <p>The Dayton, Ohio Code and Coffee meet up is on Tuesday mornings at <a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?v=2&amp;FORM=LMLTCC&amp;cp=39.694286~-84.10151&amp;style=r&amp;lvl=16&amp;tilt=-90&amp;dir=0&amp;alt=-1000&amp;phx=0&amp;phy=0&amp;phscl=1&amp;ss=yp.caribou%20coffee~pg.1~sst.0&amp;encType=1">Caribou Coffee at The Greene</a>.&#160; We typically start at 715am and finish up whenever the last person needs to leave.&#160; In the last several months, we have worked through <a href="http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans">EdgeCase&#8217;s Ruby Koans</a> and <a href="http://github.com/schambers/solid-principles">Sean Chambers&#8217; SOLID presentation</a> as a group.&#160; The schedule is really informal (you can read that as &quot;there is no schedule&quot;), so who knows what is next. </p>  <p>If there is a meet up similar to this in your area already, I encourage you to get involved.&#160; Here are the groups I know of in the southwest Ohio area:</p>  <ul>   <li>Cincinnati - <a href="http://cinnug.org/">Bitslingers</a>, Monday evenings at <a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/?v=2&amp;ss=ypid.YN691x12091955&amp;encType=1">Panera Bread at Deerfield Towne Center</a> (6pm) and Thursday mornings Panera Bread in Kenwood (630am) </li>    <li>Columbus - <a href="http://www.codeandcoffee.info/">Code and Coffee</a>, Friday mornings at varied locations </li>    <li>Dayton - Code and Coffee, Tuesday mornings at <a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?v=2&amp;FORM=LMLTCC&amp;cp=39.694286~-84.10151&amp;style=r&amp;lvl=16&amp;tilt=-90&amp;dir=0&amp;alt=-1000&amp;phx=0&amp;phy=0&amp;phscl=1&amp;ss=yp.caribou%20coffee~pg.1~sst.0&amp;encType=1">Caribou Coffee at The Greene</a>, 715am</li> </ul>  <p>If there isn&#8217;t a Code and Coffee group in your area, maybe there is a similar group of developers that meet for lunch or in the evening.&#160; If you still can&#8217;t find one, why not start your own?&#160; These sessions are usually very informal, but one of the key things I would suggest is to keep it as open as possible.&#160; In other words, don&#8217;t exclude people by making it a language specific group.&#160; All developers, regardless of language preference, should be invited to attend and get involved.&#160; We can learn a lot from each other by reaching across the language and technology boundaries. </p>

<time datetime="2009-07-23T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 23<span>rd</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been reading a lot lately, mostly around how to develop better user experiences. Most of my recent reads have been less focused on programming languages and more focused on strategies and thought processes that empower developers to build better user experiences.</p>

<p>The bottom line is, the user experience is arguably the most important aspect of any project. Sure, it is important to have a functioning application that works as expected, but if the user experience does not let your users use the application functionality to solve their problems and meet their needs, the extra features you added to the application code are worthless. This does not mean that the user experience of every application needs to be built in some form of rich application environment (i.e. Silverlight, WPF, Flex, etc.). Even though this would certainly be nice eye candy, some applications just do not warrant the need for a rich application interface. But that does not mean the user experience is not important – you can develop a great user experience regardless of the UI technology.</p>

<p>One of the books I am currently reading is “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Subject-Change-Creating-Products-Uncertain/dp/0596516835/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1245298381&amp;sr=8-1">Subject to Change: Creating Great Products and Services for an Uncertain World</a>” by a group of authors from <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/">Adaptive Path</a>, a user experience strategy and design company located in San Francisco. Here are a few excellent points I have picked up on so far that I thought were worth sharing.</p>

<h3>Empathy is your most valuable tool</h3>

<p>A key point that is stressed throughout the book is the use of empathy in user experience design. To quote the folks from Adaptive Path, “empathy is an understanding of a person or group’s subjective experience by sharing that experience vicariously.” If you have empathy for your audience, you can really start to see what drives their behaviors rather than just observing them as some type of action.</p>

<h3>Empathy is not sympathy</h3>

<p>Empathy and sympathy are two completely different emotions. Sympathy could be (1) pity for the user or it could be (2) a feeling generated by actually sharing an experience with the user, both of which do not have a place in the software design process. Pity can sometimes lead to a sense of superiority, which is definitely not what you want. And If the user and the designer both share the same experience, the designer’s objectivity can be removed and he/she can sometimes get “too close” to the problem. Empathy however keeps you at a distance with an objective point of view.</p>

<h3>Users are human beings and not market segments</h3>

<p>Having empathy for your users and understanding them as human beings and not as market segments or demographics will greatly increase your chances of developing a quality user experience. One example of developing empathy, which is mentioned in the book, is the redesign of two Huggies products by Kimberly-Clark. After conducting a significant amount of research in families homes, they noticed that parents were often struggling to hold babies while diapering and bathing them. Based on these observations, the product designers at Kimberly-Clark redesigned their baby wipes packaging to make it easier to pull out wipes with one hand. By observing users in their homes while they live their everyday lives, researchers were able to develop empathy for the users (in this case, the parents) in regards to how they use the product.</p>

<p>So the key points are (1) empathy, not sympathy, and (2) human beings, not market segments. Once you understand these points, you are well on your way to better understanding your users and their needs.</p>

<p>Anything else you think is key when it comes to empathy and user experiences? Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m in the process of updating my blog template, so if you happen to stumble on this blog and wonder why the styles keep changing, well now you know why.</p>

<p>The blog is hosted by Blogger (I know, I know… but I think Blogger is great as far as the engine goes).  The actual interfaces you use to manage templates, styles, posts, etc. are somewhat limited at best, but there are ways to work smarter when it comes to this stuff… more on that later.</p>

<p>So far, the theme is simple, which is what I’m looking for, but I think it needs something else so expect more changes to come in the near future. I’m looking at adding some Silverlight controls and/or navigation as well as some Twitter info.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, you can also expect some content in the near future as well. I have a couple things in the pipeline, so – stay tuned!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s true&#8230; I&#8217;m finally starting a blog. I have actually been thinking of starting a blog for awhile now, but it has taken a considerable amount of thought to decide what I would actually want to blog about.</p>

<p>I knew whatever I blogged about, it would be software related. That was the easy decision. But what software? Should this blog be about one specific language (C#, Java, etc.) or should I branch out and include other languages? Do I just blog about features of the language I&#8217;m familiar with, or do I also blog about features I&#8217;m learning? Or maybe I should just blog about IDE&#8217;s and utilities that make software development easier (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default.aspx">Visual Studio</a>, <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/">LINQPad</a>, <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2</a>&#8230;).</p>

<p>A little background info on me, to give you an idea where I&#8217;m coming from. I graduated from the <a href="http://www.udayton.edu/">University of Dayton</a> in 2004 with a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering. My first job out of college was with a consulting company in Cincinnati called Software Architects (SARK for short). I spent three years with this company as a Java/Oracle developer. They aren&#8217;t around anymore as they were purchased by <a href="http://www.us.sogeti.com/">Sogeti USA LLC</a> shortly before I left.</p>

<p>In June 2007, my wife and I moved to Dayton, Ohio for her job. I also switched jobs at that point and accepted a .NET developer position with <a href="http://www.theberrycompany.com/">The Berry Company</a>. Switching from Java to .NET was a farily easy transition for me - for the most part, the languages are fairly similar. Now I&#8217;m a Senior Web Developer with Berry and have been there for the last 1.5+ years.</p>

<p>Even though I&#8217;m a .NET web developer mostly developing in ASP.NET, I&#8217;m extremely interested in other software development technologies. For example, I would really like to learn more about development on a Mac (<a href="http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/">Cocoa</a> and Objective C). I am also interested in learning more about the <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web Toolkit</a> (GWT) and the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">Yahoo User Interface</a> (YUI) libraries.</p>

<p>So getting back to what the topic of this blog is going to be. After a lot of consideration about what I know, what I enjoy doing, and what else I would like to learn, I am hoping this blog will be about everything I mentioned before. I would like to share what I can, both from my experiences at work as I develop in ASP.NET and C#, but also from my experiences outside of work as I learn and play around with new technologies.</p>

<p>As I come across new programming problems and solutions at work, I will be sure to blog about them here as it is very probable there is someone else in the world that is trying to solve the same problem as me at the exact same time. Also, I hope to blog about new technologies as I learn them - sharing and documenting my learning experiences (both the good ones and the mistakes).</p>

<p>Hopefully this blog will be of interest to you and a learning experience for all of us. If you have any feedback, feel free to post any comments or suggestions and I will do my best to respond to each one.</p>
