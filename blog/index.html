  <div class="entry-content"><p>When working with HTML lists, there will be a time when you want to modify the styles for the first or last item in the list. For example, maybe you increase the margin between each item, but also need an additional buffer before the first item or after the last item in the list.</p>

<p>This has traditionally been solved using special CSS classes that are applied to only the first and last items in the list. But wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if the HTML markup only had to worry about the content and your styles could deal with selecting and styling the first/last items in the list?</p>

<p>Enter the CSS3 selectors of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:first-child">&ldquo;first-child&rdquo;</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:last-child">&ldquo;last-child&rdquo;</a>.  These selectors aren&rsquo;t anything new as they have been part of the CSS3 spec for years.  But I find this design pattern coming in handy frequently, so it&rsquo;s worth repeating here.</p>

<p>For the examples below, let&rsquo;s use an unordered list of items. In this case, our items are characters from Game of Thrones.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>first-child, last-child</h3>

<p>The pseudo-selectors of &ldquo;first-child&rdquo; and &ldquo;last-child&rdquo; give that additional level of control for styling just the first or last elements in a collection of child elements, and let you do that without cluttering up your markup with additional classes.</p>

<p>For example, using the &ldquo;last-child&rdquo; selector, you can easily modify the bottom margin of the last item in the list to match the top margin that is already applied to all of the items in the list.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>main.css </span></figcaption>

<h3>nth-child</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child">&ldquo;nth-child&rdquo;</a> pseudo-selector gives you even more control, allowing you to select a specific occurrence of a child element.  Let&rsquo;s say you want to style the background color of the 2nd item in the list.  No big deal with the &ldquo;nth-child&rdquo; pseudo-selector. Just remember that the first item in the list is element 1 &ndash; no zero based lists here!</p>

<h3>Even and Odd Children</h3>

<p>For our Game of Thrones character list, just changing the background color of the 2nd item in the list isn&rsquo;t that useful. But, we can use the same pseudo-selector to style the background color of all of the even/odd items in the list.  To do this, we use the &ldquo;even&rdquo; or &ldquo;odd&rdquo; keyword with the nth-child selector to select just the even/odd items.</p>

<h3>Browser Support</h3>

<p>Whenever we discuss CSS, it&rsquo;s worth reviewing the browser support for these <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">selectors</a>. As of this time, all of these selectors are supported in the latest versions of the major desktop and mobile browsers, but some browsers (a&#8217;hem &ndash; IE) did not support all of these selectors until more recently. For example, IE has supported the &ldquo;first-child&rdquo; selector since IE7, but did not add support for &ldquo;last-child&rdquo; or &ldquo;nth-child&rdquo; until IE9.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I want to ship code.  I want to provide value.  I&rsquo;m a coder, and there are not many things I get more satisfaction out of than seeing someone use my code.  There are few things more gratifying than watching someone find value in something I produce.</p>

<p>But why do we care so much about shipping?</p>

<p>Someone recently asked me why some developers care so much about shipping.  I was speechless at first, and kind of taken aback.  I didn&rsquo;t know how to respond.  Doesn&rsquo;t every developer want to ship code?</p>

<p>After letting this question sit in the back of mind for a couple days, I came to one conclusion: If we don&rsquo;t care about shipping, then what the hell are we doing?  If we don&rsquo;t care about providing value to customers and delivering awesome software, then why do we come to work each day?</p>

<p>Seriously, it&rsquo;s a valid question.  Sure, it&rsquo;s fun to learn new technology and build prototypes, but I want to create something that has a purpose.  I want to build something useful.  And then I want to step back and let someone use it.  I want to step back and let someone find value in something I created.</p>

<p>But shipping is hard &ndash; maybe initially we have to deal with building out new environments, and then figure out what it means to deploy.  And if we want to plan to ship frequently, we have to start tackling complex problems, like how do we upgrade our applications <a href="http://www.cio.com/article/728269/3_Ways_to_Be_More_Agile_With_Software_Shipping_Decisions">without rebooting the server</a> or how do we deploy new features to &ldquo;beta customers&rdquo; without rolling these features to our entire customerbase?  These are hard problems.  And we should be thinking about them from the very beginning.  For me, the Scrum process, as defined by <a href="http://www.scrum.org/">Scrum.org</a>, is the framework for thinking about these complex problems by emphasizing incremental deliveries of <strong><em>done done</em></strong> (not just done, but&hellip;) working software.</p>

<p>We know nothing until we ship.  As <a href="https://twitter.com/cromwellryan">Ryan Cromwell</a> reminded me today, everything we have done so far is an assumption until we&rsquo;ve shipped it.  Every design document and architecture decision made by our team is merely an assumption until validated with actual, working software in a production environment.  Shipping exposes our team&rsquo;s <strong><em>actual</em></strong> strengths and weaknesses instead of our <strong><em>assumed</em></strong> strengths and weaknesses.  We are forced to deal with <a href="http://blog.the-monastery.com/2013/04/the-importance-of-shipping-software.html">reality instead of fantasy</a>.  And the sooner we face this reality, the sooner we will be able to start identifying what new features our organization or customers would like to see next.</p>

<p>Only then can you get the true satisfaction of knowing we are building the <strong><em>right</em></strong> thing.  Otherwise, what the hell are we doing?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a little belated, but I did want to recap the two great days I spent in Knoxville, TN on July 12th-13th at CodeStock 2013. Many thanks to all of the organizers, sponsors, speakers, and attendees.  The session content this year was a great! Here is a quick recap of a few of the great sessions I had the privilege of attending:</p>

<h3>An Honest Look at Being Independent &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/beefarino">Jim Christopher</a></h3>

<p>I started off the conference with a look into the world of being an independent developer.  The tax implications involved when going independent and organizing as an LLC vs 1099 were definitely interesting.  Note for my future self: hire a lawyer to clarify all of this for me when I decide to take off as an independent developer.</p>

<h3>Agile Retrospectives For High Performing Teams: Experiments to Take Them to the Next Level &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/derekhubbard">Derek Hubbard</a></h3>

<p>Next up was my session on Agile Retrospectives.  After a quick count of the number of attendees in the room before I started, I think there were at least 30 people in the room &ndash; plus a few additional late arrivals &ndash; so a great turnout.  This was my first time presenting this session and the amount of participation from the attendees was great.  I have some ideas to tighten up the presentation for next time.  If you attended my session and have any feedback &ndash; both good or bad &ndash; definitely <a href="https://twitter.com/derekhubbard">hit me up on Twitter</a> and let me know!</p>

<h3>Getting Started with iOS Development with Xamarin &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/smartyp">Roger Peters</a></h3>

<p>After a quick bite to eat, I caught a good introduction to iOS development with Xamarin. When it comes to learning a new tech, this session and another &ldquo;Intro to Xamarin&rdquo; session by Firefly Logic&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/ben_henderson">Ben Henderson</a> were probably the most interesting to me.  The possibilities of where Xamarin will head in the upcoming months and years are exciting.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Scrummerfall &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/cromwellryan">Ryan Cromwell</a></h3>

<p>Day 2 of CodeStock 2013 started with a great session from my colleague, Ryan Cromwell, on how to avoid the pitfalls of &ldquo;Scrummerfall.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s way too easy for teams to fall back into the bad habits of waterfall and Ryan did a great job of going through some of the indicators that identify your team might be sliding back towards waterfall without even realizing it.</p>

<h3>Become an Outlier: Career Advice for the Developer Mind &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/housecor">Cory House</a></h3>

<p>The next session of the day was probably the highlight of my weekend. Cory&rsquo;s session on how to become an &ldquo;Outlier&rdquo;, which is loosely based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell">Malcolm Gladwell&rsquo;s</a> book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930">&ldquo;Outliers&rdquo;</a>, was a thoughtprovoking look into how to enhance your skillset as a developer and work towards becoming an &ldquo;outlier&rdquo; &ndash; a person with a high level of success.  Cory&rsquo;s blend of personal anecdotes, humor, and even an inspirational <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBvppEgFJkw">video narrated by Alan Watts</a> all combined for a great session.  If you have the opportunity to catch Cory&rsquo;s &ldquo;Outliers&rdquo; session at a conference near you, you won&rsquo;t regret it &ndash; it&rsquo;s time well spent.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of my favorite new features in TFS 2012 are the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jasonz/archive/2012/05/29/my-favorite-features-managing-projects-with-the-backlog-sprint-planning-and-taskboard-features-in-team-foundation-server-11.aspx">significant improvements</a> to the TFS web client.  Sprint planning and execution has never been easier &ndash; especially for remote teams &ndash; when using the new team task board in TFS 2012.</p>

<h3>The Perfect World</h3>

<p>I have been working with a remote team for the last two years and our biggest challenge has always been communication &ndash; especially because <em>everyone</em> is remote, not just one or two individuals.  The Daily Scrum helps keep the communication lines flowing for the team at the beginning of each day.  Being part of a remote team, this is usually handled with an audio conference bridge.  And more often than not, it&rsquo;s challenging to form a good understanding of what each team member is actively working on.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, if we were all colocated, this wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue &ndash; the development team would reap the benefits of standing together as a group for our Daily Scrum, gathered in the same room, most likely in front of a physical task board used to track work throughout the sprint.  Everyone would be able to identify what work has been completed, what is in progress, and what is remaining.  We could even plot our own burndown on the white board to gauge if we will finish on time.</p>

<h3>Reality</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, the colocated Daily Scrum isn&rsquo;t an option for us, but the next best thing is for the team to review the new team task board together.  The team task board, which ships with both Team Foundation Server 2012 and TF Service, is a virtual representation of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scrumshortcuts/6435649305/">physical task board</a> used by colocated teams.  Virtual sticky notes can be moved from one swim lane to another, while updating the affected work items behind the scenes.<br/>
<strong>Bonus: Have a touch-enabled desktop or Windows 8 tablet?  The task board supports touch events, allowing users to drag virtual stickies from one swim lane to the next. </strong></p>

<p>Simply reviewing the task board together as a team on a daily basis not only helped ensure everyone was actively working on what we committed to at the beginning of the sprint, but also helped everyone on the team form a shared understanding of what each team member is working on and how that work fits into the team&rsquo;s overall sprint goals.  Team collaboration and communication for the win.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are interested in learning and playing around with the new features in Visual Studio 2012 and Team Foundation Server 2012, but do not have access to a TFS 2012 environment yet (or maybe you get slapped on the wrist every time you try to install something new on your work machine), then the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/briankel/archive/2011/09/16/visual-studio-11-application-lifecycle-management-virtual-machine-and-hands-on-labs-demo-scripts.aspx">Visual Studio 2012 Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) Virtual Machine</a> is for you.&nbsp; </p> <p>The ALM demo virtual machine includes both Visual Studio 2012 and Team Foundation Server 2012, plus you also get 20 hands on labs that walk you through all of the new features. The demo virtual machine is only good for a trial period of 180 days, but you can most likely expect a refreshed version of the virtual machine from Microsoft before then.&nbsp; </p> <h3>VirtualBox Support</h3> <p>The demo virtual machine will also work with VirtualBox, even though the blog post and release notes state the machine is built for Hyper-V.&nbsp; </p> <p>To run the virtual machine with VirtualBox, download and expand the self-extracting RAR files first, following the instructions provided in Brian Keller’s blog post.&nbsp; </p> <p>After extracting, you now need to create a new virtual machine using VirtualBox.&nbsp; When creating the new virtual machine, specify Windows 2008 (64-bit) for the VM operating system.&nbsp; </p> <p><a href="/images/posts/SNAGHTML562929a.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="SNAGHTML562929a" border="0" alt="SNAGHTML562929a" src="/images/posts/SNAGHTML562929a_thumb.png" width="553" height="361"></a></p> <p>Specify an appropriate amount of memory for your new virtual machine on the next screen.&nbsp; The amount of memory you designate for your virtual machine may vary on the hardware in your machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p><a href="/images/posts/SNAGHTML56ea38b.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="SNAGHTML56ea38b" border="0" alt="SNAGHTML56ea38b" src="/images/posts/SNAGHTML56ea38b_thumb.png" width="551" height="360"></a></p> <p>For the Virtual Hard Disk, specify “Use existing hard disk” and locate the vhd that was contained in the folder structure generated by the self-extracting RAR files.&nbsp; </p> <p><a href="/images/posts/SNAGHTML563d718.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="SNAGHTML563d718" border="0" alt="SNAGHTML563d718" src="/images/posts/SNAGHTML563d718_thumb.png" width="558" height="364"></a></p> <p>You’re almost done – click Create!</p> <p>After creating, you will need to make sure you do one last step.&nbsp; Hyper-V will only build a bootable IDE hard disk, so you will need to change the settings of your new virtual machine to attach the hard disk as a bootable IDE, instead of SATA, which is the default.&nbsp; Just delete the existing hard disk, which was by default attached via the SATA controller, and add a new hard disk using the IDE controller, again pointing to the vhd which you extracted earlier.&nbsp; </p> <p>Thanks to Olof Szymczak for explaining <a href="http://ollysense.blogspot.com/2010/05/virtualbox-using-hyper-v-vhd-image.html">how to open a Hyper-V VM in VirtualBox</a>.&nbsp; </p> <p><a href="/images/posts/SNAGHTML572dd9e.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="SNAGHTML572dd9e" border="0" alt="SNAGHTML572dd9e" src="/images/posts/SNAGHTML572dd9e_thumb.png" width="565" height="422"></a></p> <p>You are done.&nbsp; Launch your ALM virtual machine and “get your learning on!”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The project I am currently working on is using Team Foundation Server for builds and we have a lot of build definitions.  The project is a large enterprise-level project, with multiple Visual Studio solutions.  Each Visual Studio solution has at least two branches – maybe more – and usually a corresponding build definition for most of those branches.  Hopefully that gives you a good idea of the number of build definitions.</p>

<p>One of my coworkers at this client was nice enough to point me towards the Inmeta Build Explorer add-in for Visual Studio.  The add-in plugs directly into the Team Explorer window in Visual Studio and provides you an organized hierarchical list of the build definitions in your team project.  This is done using a naming convention for the builds in your team project.  The add-in uses “.” as the default separator, but the developers of the add-in were nice enough to make it customizable.  And the Inmeta Build Explorer add-in is a client plugin, so only the developers on your team that are interested in using it have to install it – if you don’t look at the build definitions on a daily basis, then you don’t have to install it.</p>

<p>Just to give you an idea of the structure of the builds underneath the Inmeta Build Explorer node, here is what the Inmeta Build Explorer add-in looks like in our team project.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/images/posts/Win7Dev-1-1-2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-214 aligncenter" title="Win7Dev-1-1-2" src="/images/posts/Win7Dev-1-1-2.jpg" alt="" width="318" height="342" /></a></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another nice feature of this add-in is the ability to easily queue up the “default” build for a specific build definition.  If you right-click on one of the builds, an option named “Queue Default Build(s)” is available on the context menu.  Selecting this will automatically queue a new build for that build definition, bypassing the build properties window that lets you override the default build settings.</p>

<p>You can get the Inmeta Build Explorer on the Visual Studio Gallery.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Caffeine, pizza, and anxiety are regular tools for a production deployment.  Watch and learn how Team Foundation Build 2010 and MSDeploy can turn the last hurdle of software development into a moment of zen.  Deploying software can be hard, but it doesn’t have to be if you practice the hard things along the way.</p>

<p>In this webinar, we’ll take a look at how to configure a new <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181710(VS.80).aspx" target="_blank">Team Build</a> definition for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration" target="_blank">Continuous Integration</a>.  Then we will walk through creating an MSDeploy package from an ASP.NET MVC project, and automate the execution of the MSDeploy package to remote servers using our Continuous Integration build definition.</p>

<p>The webinar will be April 28th from 12pm-1pm EST.  For more information and to register to attend, check out the <a href="http://www.sds-consulting.com/tfs-training-series-free-continuous-deployment-team-build-and-msdeploy" target="_blank">Strategic Data Systems website</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1301795502&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"><em>Rework</em></a> by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson. Pub by Crown Publishing. ISBN 10 9780307463746.</p>

<p>So I know that this book has been out for awhile, and actually, I have owned this book for awhile.  Actually, if we’re being exact, I’ve owned two copies of this book for quite some time now.  It’s a funny story… ok, so not actually, but anyway – here is why I have two copies of this book.  I ordered the book off <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a> when it first hit bookshelves.  However, I wanted to read it so badly and I couldn’t wait until it was shipped to my house, so I picked up a copy at the local <a href="http://www.booksandco.com/" target="_blank">Books and Company</a> store.  I took that copy home, and started to read it.  And, eventually, the copy I had ordered off Amazon.com finally arrived.  Although at that point, life had already moved on and I never did remember to take back the original copy I had picked up at Books and Company.  So, now I have two copies.  And I finally finished reading one of those copies just a couple weeks ago on the plane, and here is the review.  This blog post does have a point – I promise.</p>

<p><em>Rework</em> is one of the most interesting – and most realistic – business books I have seen in a while.  And it’s one of the more unique business books I have read.  It’s unique because, in all of its simplicity, the authors of this book seem to understand how to start (and run) a business more than most others.</p>

<p>The authors start off with some very basic suggestions on how to start your own business.  But rather than walk you through the step-by-step process for creating everything from business cards to marketing material, they help the reader consider the most important things first.  You don’t have to give up your 9-5 job to start doing something you love.  You can start working on something with a little as an hour a day, and if you’re truly passionate about this interest and it’s more than a hobby, then you will stick with it – oh, and about those business cards – they can wait.  The key is to prioritize your list of tasks and expenses, and focus on the most important things first.</p>

<p>The book continues by discussing how to build your idea into a productive business, when to grow (or not grow) your business, and how to deal with everyday business scenarios like hiring, marketing, and bad press.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a no-crap book on how to turn your ideas into a sustainable business, then look no further – start by reading <em>Rework</em>.</p>
